        1. During test discovery process, the parameter decorators are executed and the resource
           identifier names and source functions are registered and available for consumption via
           a query interface or by the test sequencer when generating the test execution flow code.

           The source functions and identifiers being registered are stored in the scope tree in
           order to build data structure that allows for the resolution of scope for the parameters
           that and associated identifiers that will be consumed by tests during the execution of
           the test execution sequence flow. (This is an implicit step)

        2. After all the tests have been imported and test references have been created, we go through
           all of the test references and ensure we have a completely filled out scope tree for all of
           the tests.  As we go we mark scopes as relavant so we can later go back through the tree
           and prune scope nodes that are not relavant to executing a test.

        3. Walk through the entire scope tree and prune non-relevant nodes starting at the leaves and
           working backwards until a relavant node is reached or the root of the tree is reached.

        4. Iterate over the test references and for each test reference, walk through the now pruned
           scope tree utilizing a parameter visibility dictionary chain assigning usages to each
           ParameterOrigin object as a reference is found.  As we walk, we make sure that any parameters
           reference in the current scope are visible in the current parameter dictionary and if not
           store information about the missing parameter.

        5. Go through all of the test references and for each test reference, collect integration and
           scope couplings that are referenced so we can build a combined picture of everything that
           is being coupled into the test run.
